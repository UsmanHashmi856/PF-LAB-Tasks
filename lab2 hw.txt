Objective 2: PSEUDOCODE

Task 2: Take three variables as input and add them without using the + operator.

START
INPUT num1
INPUT num2
INPUT num3
Result = 0
Result = -( - num1 – num2 -num3)
OUTPUT Result

Task 3: Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+, -, *, /, %)

START
INPUT Operation (+, -, *, /, %)
INPUT num1
INPUT num2
Result = num1 Operation num2
OUTPUT Result

Objective 3: ALGORITHM

Task 1: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.

Step 1: User enters Nth number and n.
Step 2: check if Nth can be divided by n.
Step 3: divide Nth by n.
Step 4: check if answer is even by dividing by 2.
Step 4: if remainder 0 then print even else print odd.


Task 3: Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+, -, *, /, %)

Step 1: User enters operation to be performed.
Step 2: user enters 2 numbers.
Step 3: the numbers are calculated using the operator.
Step 4: the result is displayed.
