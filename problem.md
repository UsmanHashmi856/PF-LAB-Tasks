Task 1: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

Step 1: User enters Nth number and n./
Step 2: check if Nth can be divided by n.
Step 3: divide Nth by n.
Step 4: check if answer is even by dividing by 2.
Step 4: if remainder 0 then print even else print odd.
